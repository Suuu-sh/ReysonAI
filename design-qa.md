# Design QA — Persisted Estimated Ranges (2026-09-23)

This report supersedes the historical API Explorer/mock-data checks. The current UI uses saved estimated JSON only; API, SDK and Solver remain separate systems.

## Current scope and sources
- Black/pink single estimated-range view with opening, open-response, 3bet-response and 4bet-response selections.
- Four persisted datasets: 5 opening spots plus 15 spots in each response dataset; 8,450 hand records total.
- Four-bet path: opener 2.5BB → later Hero 3bet → opener 4bet → original 3bettor Hero responds. Three-bet response Hero remains the opener.
- Existing JSON controls raise-to sizes, not the separate Solver multipliers. Five-bet is `all_in`, total 100BB only. Ante metadata normalized to zero with user approval.
- Estimates only, with no GTO/EV claim, competitor chart reuse, runtime generation or API fallback.

## Automated verification
- `npm run build` and `npm run test:sites` pass in `apps/preflop-ui`; Sites client/server/hosting outputs are present.
- `node --test tests/*.test.mjs`: 37 tests pass (including Sites tests).
- New data checks cover every one of the 15 spots, IDs, source sizes, 169 unique canonical hands, frequency totals, legal all-in size and zero-3bet reachability.
- Every spot is mutation-tested for malformed sizes/IDs/hands/frequencies, invalid reasons and unreachable continuation. Missing JSON, malformed syntax and corrupted upstream data fail closed.
- Server-rendered UI tests verify Hero roles, sizes, all-in labels and absence of matrix/bars on errors.
- Rust workspace tests, TypeScript SDK tests (8) and Edge API tests (5) pass.

## Browser verification — local app at port 4173
- All 15 opener/Hero combinations selected and checked in the four-bet view; Hero remains the original 3bettor.
- BTN/BB shows 12BB 3bet → 26.5BB 4bet. AKo: all-in 85%, call 15%, fold 0%, total 100BB all-in.
- UTG/HJ shows 8BB → 22BB, AA shows all-in 90%, call 10%.
- Changing opener from UTG with Hero HJ to SB automatically selects the only legal Hero BB; BB opener and earlier Hero seats stay disabled.
- 5bet action filter works. AA (6 combos) and AKo (12 combos) details reflect saved values.
- 72o shows 「対象外（到達不能）」 and its saved explanation; no recommendation bars or fold=100 frequency display. Matrix uses marked/striped cells without action strips.
- Temporarily replaced the new JSON with malformed syntax: explicit error, zero matrices. Then temporarily removed it: explicit 「データなし」 error, zero matrices. The selector still switched to valid 3bet data. Restored the exact saved file and verified normal four-bet display again. No fixture remains in the application.
- Existing opener-range focus and 「両方のレンジを表示」 comparison recovery verified; comparison returns to two matrices.
- Internal screenshot inspected at 1280×720: matrix, selected-hand frequencies, raise-to sizes and non-GTO metadata visible. Longer conditions remain in the existing internally scrollable details column.
- Narrow default in-app viewport inspected: selectors wrap, matrix and stacked detail layout remain usable. Temporary viewport override reset.
- Local server remains running with the four-bet view open for user inspection.

## Boundaries
- No claim of exact reference-image fidelity or GTO strategy quality.
- Vite reports the existing large-bundle warning; build succeeds. All persisted data is bundled, without lazy-loading optimization in this change.
- Non-all-in 5bet, cold 4bet, squeezes, callers, and the opener’s response to a 5bet are out of scope.
